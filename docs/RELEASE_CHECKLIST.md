# Release checklist

Status: v27.21.1.

## Local gate

```bash
mvn -B --no-transfer-progress test
bash deploy/scripts/release-check.sh
```

When Docker is available:

```bash
docker build -t dutylog:release-check .
bash deploy/scripts/migration-smoke-test.sh dutylog:release-check
```

## Staging

- push the exact candidate tree to `test`;
- confirm the Maven gate executes all 525 tests with zero failures after the frontend contract alignment;
- confirm fresh schedule apply reloads the authoritative month through the data layer;
- confirm `Deploy staging` is green;
- verify calendar, note search/export/offline queued edits, tasks, overtime, modules, admin and Android API v1;
- verify schedule-template list seeds five presets exactly once and built-ins open as copies;
- preview a four-day cycle with an occupied date and confirm safe mode reports `SKIP_CONFLICT`;
- apply the preview and confirm manual edits remain possible afterward;
- create a companion layer in another IANA timezone and verify month/week/day projection plus server-owned visibility;
- open an important-event details card, choose Edit, save and confirm both details/editor modals are hidden before navigating to Settings;
- in Day mode call the same-date flow again and confirm the selected-day panel stays open without requiring the hidden month grid;
- from the hourly Day view press «Все детали дня», confirm Month mode and the full selected-day panel become visible, then open Notes;
- edit an existing note offline, reload offline, reconnect and confirm the pending `updateNote` queue drains and the text survives an online reload;
- confirm creating, pinning, moving and deleting notes remain disabled offline while editing an existing note remains enabled;
- create an important date, timed event and multi-day period; verify read-first details, all-day rail and hourly timeline;
- change canonical timezone and verify timed events keep canonical instants while all-day dates/periods stay floating;
- create all-day, point, same-day and overnight task plans and verify the hourly timeline uses exact duration;
- verify a deadline before planned end is rejected while a later deadline/reminder stays independent;
- verify the timed-task editor reports «Дедлайн не может быть раньше окончания запланированного интервала.» and keeps the modal open;
- change canonical timezone and confirm timed planning keeps source provenance while all-day dates stay floating;
- verify project suggestions/chips/filter/search and Inbox search across open/archived/local queued entries;
- verify `/api/tasks/board?from=...&to=...` still filters by deadline/date for older clients;
- verify `/api/tasks/board?scheduledFrom=...&scheduledTo=...` filters by planned overlap, including overnight intervals;
- verify the Web/PWA board date fields and «этот месяц» use the planned-range contract;
- verify `/actuator/info` shows staging, commit and build metadata;
- verify Shift Worker / Planner / Minimal navigation and hidden-route links;
- verify Dashboard / Compact / Focus on desktop and mobile;
- verify theme + palette independence and automatic persistence after reload;
- verify custom accent → Theme palette restores both theme accents without switching themes;
- verify «Вернуть цвета темы» also works while the select already says Theme palette;
- verify Theme / Preset / Custom palette status and reload persistence;
- verify Outline keeps a visible border while Ghost has no visible idle border/shadow and gains a hover surface;
- verify Secondary / Danger / Link / Icon preview variants, disabled state, keyboard focus and phone touch targets;
- verify no Classic selector remains and `shellMode=classic` from an old local cache still boots the single shell;
- verify Appearance remains open after reload and workspace/layout/palette persist;
- verify Overtime Next summary, Month/Year/All-time presets, daily/monthly chart keys and FIFO queue;
- verify `account-page` returns canonical `usages` and summary/chart show the same `+5 / −4 / +1` snapshot;
- verify reopening an already selected calendar day keeps the panel and timezone projection visible;
- verify the professional ledger table on desktop and detailed credit cards on a phone viewport;
- verify credit/usage editors, legacy migration and CSV/Excel export remain available;
- test the migration against the persistent staging database;
- optionally reset staging and verify a clean V1..latest install.

## Production

- merge the tested tree into `main`/`master` without additional changes;
- confirm production resolved `staging-tested-tree-*`;
- confirm a verified pre-deploy dump was created;
- confirm health and smoke checks passed;
- verify production data remains intact;
- copy a recent backup off the VPS.

## Security and isolation

- staging and production `.env` files use different secrets;
- PostgreSQL is not attached to the shared edge network;
- app images are referenced by `@sha256:` digest;
- deployment SSH host keys use strict known-host checking;
- host `.env` files are not overwritten by CI;
- application container runs as non-root;
- production registration starts closed;
- no workflow runs `down -v` against production.
